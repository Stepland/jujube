# jujube
jujube will be a cross-platform FLOSS jubeat simulator,

I'm still unsure about the name

Its main goal is to be easy to install and use on Windows, Mac and Linux

## Planned Features
### 100% Sure
* Basic music select, gameplay, results screen loop
* Full 4x4 interface and controls
* Youbeat memo and .memon format compatibility
### Maybe
* Easy FB9 integration
### I'll try
* p4io support
* Themes/Skins
